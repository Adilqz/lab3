# ROBT 403 Laboratory

## Lab Assignment 3 Task 1 - Joint movement of the planar robot
TASK: 

Create a rosnode that will “listen” for std_msgs/Float64 type data and “publish” this data to the joint of the planar robot. The node should send the command to move if the any new incoming value is lower than the previous one.

## Lab Assignment 3 Task 2 - Step and sine wave response of the planar robot
TASK:

II) Get the step response of (you can create a node that will send a square-wave function): 1.the joint at the base of the robot 2.the joint at the end-effector of the robot

III) Get the sine-wave response of (you can create a node that will send a sine-wave function): 3.the joint at the base of the robot 4.the joint at the end-effector of the robot
